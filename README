This is a WIP but it works fine as long as all you want to do is:
 - get the contents of an object in a bucket
 - simple uploads/updates of small objects (no multipart)

The authorization api should also be usable outside of the main library
here. Just call `connection.sign()` on a request and it will add the
authorization header - don't add any more headers after that though or they
won't be included in the signature!
