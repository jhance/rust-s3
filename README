This is a WIP but it works fine as long as all you want to do is:
 - get the contents of an object in a bucket
 - simple uploads/updates of small objects (no multipart)

The authorization api should also be usable outside of the main library
here. Just call `connection.sign()` on a request and it will add the
authorization header - don't add any more headers after that though or they
won't be included in the signature!

Doing simple things is easy! Load your credentials, create a connection, and then
create a bucket in the region you want with some name. You can then call get/put on
that and get back http responses (or use get_as_string() to skip this phase).

If you need a more advanced query, create a PutObject/GetObject, which builds the
query, and then call send() [or contents() for the equivalent of get_as_string()]
